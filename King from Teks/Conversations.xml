They call me King, though I am no royalty. This village offered hospitality and kindness when I needed it most, so I'm currently offering them my services as appreciation.

My closest friend and I were hired to escort a caravan through the nearby canyons to Kyakukya. We'd just passed Red Rock when we were accosted by a pair of bipedal bears. The encounter was hectic, to say the least, and I ended up wounded and separated from the rest of the group. Next thing I know, I'm being tended to here in Joppa. I'm not sure what happened to my friend or the caravan.

Why, that would be immensely appreciated. If you're certain, you'll find where we were attacked 3 parasangs east of Red Rock. If you can find a sign that anyone survived, bring it back here. Please, be careful.
